                <h2>A linguist's journey to web development.</h2>
                <p>Between high school and college, I have studied a total of six languages, including Japanese, Latin, German, French, Hebrew, and Greek. While I cannot fluently speak in any of them if prompted, I know how each language works.</p>
                <p>My interest in language has not necessarily been driven by the desire to communicate, but instead by the inner workings of each system—how each language is structured, the moving parts, and the logic behind construction and use. </p>
                <p>My interest in coding began as an epiphany; I realized in a singular moment of leisurely, curious research that coding works much like a language—or perhaps more accurately, a language system. </p>
                <p>Just as we form thought and communicate through parts of speech, technology forms its thought and communicates with itself and other databases through a system of elements, functions, and variables constructed with the same type of organization and logic that goes into the formation of sentences. </p>
                <p>The excitement this connection brought me was profound. I immediately began initiatory research followed by scoping out resources, joining various online communities, and signing up for free courses to start learning the basics. </p>
                <p>While I am still in the midst of learning, I am excited to share my portfolio and challenge my growing skillset even further. Wherever I may be on my journey, I can count on the sheer joy of learning and knowing there is an unmeasurably vast ocean of knowledge and experience yet to explore. </p>
